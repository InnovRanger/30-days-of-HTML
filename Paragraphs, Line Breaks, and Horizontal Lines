Paragraphs, Line Breaks, and Horizontal Lines

1. Paragraphs: <p>
--Used to define blocks of text.
<p>This is a paragraph of text in HTML.</p>
--Browsers automatically add space before and after paragraphs.

2. Line Breaks: <br>
--Used to break a line without starting a new paragraph.
<p>This is line one.<br>This is line two (after break).</p>
--It’s a self-closing tag (no </br> needed).

3. Horizontal Lines: <hr>
--Used to insert a horizontal line — often for section separation.
<p>This is above the line.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is below the line.</p>
--Also a self-closing tag.

👨‍💻 Example Code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>HTML Paragraphs and Lines</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Day 4: Paragraphs, Breaks, and Lines</h1>
    
    <p>This is the first paragraph.</p>
    <p>This is the second paragraph. It is separate from the first one.</p>
    
    <p>Line break example:<br>Line 1<br>Line 2<br>Line 3</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <p>This text is after a horizontal line.</p>
