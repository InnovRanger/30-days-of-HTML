HTML Comments

What is a Comment?
--An HTML comment is a note or instruction written inside the code that browsers ignore. It's used for:
1.Explaining code
2.Temporarily hiding parts of HTML
3.Leaving reminders for developers

Comment Syntax:
<!-- This is a comment -->
--You can place comments anywhere in your HTML code.

Example Code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>HTML Comments</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Day 9: Comments in HTML</h1>

    <!-- This is a comment explaining the next paragraph -->
    <p>This paragraph is visible in the browser.</p>

    <!-- <p>This paragraph is hidden and won't be shown.</p> -->

    <p>This is another visible paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>

Tip:
--Use comments to organize sections of your HTML.
--Avoid putting sensitive information in comments — users can still view them in the browser’s developer tools.
